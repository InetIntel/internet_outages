## Repository structure

### Data (`./data/`)

The `./data/` directory contains the data files required for analysis. Currently, only the dataset created by the paper's authors is available in this repository. All other datasets mentioned below were created and managed by other groups. If you require specific versions of the datasets for the purposes of replication, please refer to a Read-Only snapshot of the notebooks used for this work on the lab's Deepnote page [here](https://deepnote.com/workspace/Internet-Intelligence-Lab-Collaborators-e7724bc9-6255-4419-a248-0602280e1f81/project/DestinationUnreachable-2b9a2535-ed0e-48ec-8277-3dc0993a1e10/notebook/README-eed03f6c65444030a4dad1149c060bce?). All dataset snapshots are available in the `data` folder (described below). If you have any issues accessing this data, please feel free to contact the lead author via [email](mailto:z@chary.io) or open an issue on this repository. 

Description of files/directories:
- `./data/ioda/ioda_investigated_outages_cleaned_phase1+2.csv`: contains our manually curated list of IODA outages and shutdowns used throughout the paper. (Included in this repository)
- `./data/kio`: contains CSV files for each publication of AccessNow's #KeepItOn dataset (available [here](https://www.accessnow.org/campaign/keepiton/)). This data is used throughout the full paper. To access this dataset, visit [AccessNow's #KeepItOn page](https://www.accessnow.org/campaign/keepiton/), scroll down to a button labelled "DOWNLOAD THE 2016-2022 STOP DATA" (note: the exact wording may change as additional annual updates are posted). This should open a Google Spreadsheet with multiple sheets, with each sheet representing the annual dataset publications (e.g., 2016-2018, 2019, 2020, etc.). Our paper used a snapshot of this data, retrieved on July 12, 2022 by exporting each sheet as a CSV file. Note that our paper does not include data from 2022 as it was not available at the time of submission.
- `./data/polisci`: contains the political and economic indicators that were used throughout the analysis in Sec 5.1 and 5.2 of the paper. Democractic indices are made available by [V-dem](https://v-dem.net/data/the-v-dem-dataset/), macroeconomic data (e.g., GDP per capita, prevalence of broadband Internet access) was obtained from [The World Bank](https://databank.worldbank.org/), information on coups was collected as part of the [Global Instances of Coups](https://arresteddictatorship.com/coups/) dataset, data on elections made available by the [International Foundation for Electoral Systems-Election Guide](https://www.electionguide.org/), and data identifying protest events was obtained from the [Mass Mobilization in Autocracies Database](https://mmadatabase.org/). For our analysis, all datasets were downloaded on January 23, 2023.
  - The V-dem dataset can be downloaded [here](https://v-dem.net/data/the-v-dem-dataset/). We used the "Country-Year: V-Dem Full+Others" dataset. Downloading the dataset requires that you provide an email. Our analysis used Version 12, which can be downloaded via the [dataset archive page](https://v-dem.net/data/dataset-archive/). 
  - Macroeconomic and the prevalance of broadband Internet access data can be obtained by visiting The World Bank's DataBank's [World Development Indicators]([https://databank.worldbank.org/](https://databank.worldbank.org/source/world-development-indicators)). For our analysis, we used the DataBank portal to select the series "GDP per capita (current US$)" (code: `NY.GDP.PCAP.CD`) and "Fixed broadband subscriptions (per 100 people)" (code: `IT.NET.BBND.P2`) for all countries during the period of study (2018-2021). Upon selecting the appropriate filters, data can be downloaded via the "Download options" button.  
  - Data on Coups can be downloaded via the [Global Instances of Coups page](https://arresteddictatorship.com/coups/) via the ["List of coups by country" link](https://www.uky.edu/~clthyn2/coup_data/powell_thyne_coups_final.txt).
  - Data on elections can be obtained from the [International Foundation for Electoral Systems-Election Guide](https://www.electionguide.org/). Downloading the full dataset requires that users click "Request Data Access" and complete a brief survey. Data can be obtained as a spreadsheet or via an API. For our analysis, we obtained a spreadsheet of the full dataset. Additional information is available on Election Guide's [about page](https://www.electionguide.org/p/about/). 
  - Data on protest events can be obtained from [Mass Mobilization in Autocracies Database's downloads page](https://mmadatabase.org/get/). Our analysis used Version 4.0, via the link "MMAD Reports, Version 4.0". At the time of our work, this version was publicly available. However, access previous versions requires users to create a free account. Upon subsequent updates to this dataset, downloading this specific version of the dataset may require an account. 
- `./data/access-networks`: contains datasets related to autonomous system (AS) characteristics. This includes: CAIDA's prefix to AS mappings (available [here](https://www.caida.org/catalog/datasets/routeviews-prefix2as/)), MaxMind's geolocation data (available [here](https://www.maxmind.com/en/solutions/ip-geolocation-databases-api-services)), and APNIC's eyeball dataset (available [here](https://stats.labs.apnic.net/aspop/)). These datasets are used in Sec 5.1 of the paper.
- `./data/soe`: contains data on state ownership of ASes as part of Carisimo et. al's IMC '21 paper (available [here](https://github.com/estcarisimo/state-owned-ases)). Our version of this dataset was accessed on 2023-01-23 and is used in part of Sec 5.1 of the paper.

###  Notebooks (`./notebooks`)

The `./notebooks` directory contains the Jupyter notebooks files used for preparing, cleaning, and merging the KIO and IODA datasets as well as notebook files for the paper's analysis. 

Description of files:
- `merge-kio-ioda.ipynb`: Contains the code to load and merge the IODA and KIO datasets. Also contains code to standardize/unify the different conventions used across different versions of the KIO dataset. This will create the merged dataset required for each of the analysis notebooks.
- `polisci-analysis.ipynb`: Contains code to generate most of the figures in Sec. 5.1 and 5.2 of the paper. This includes analysis of the distribution of Internet shutdowns and spontaneous outages across multiple political and socioeconomic indicators. 
- `state-ownership-analysis.ipynb`: Contains code to generate figures specifically in Sec 5.1.1. This includes the analysis on the relationship between Internet shutdowns and state ownership of the address space/eye-ball networks.
- `summary-and-technical-analysis.ipynb`: Contains code for generating figures related to a high-level summary of the KIO dataset (Sec 3.2), examples of multiple IODA outages being mapped to a KIO shutdown (Sec 4), and the temporal and technical indicators of Internet shutdowns (Sec 5.3).
